todo:

make speed and accel controls work +protocol for it.



indi:
make serial send for Fnnn = offset -- sets offset for current filter only. They have to be tested repeatedly for centering anyway.

make store offsets to eprom command ---"G0" does it


Remove from indi driver:
  Display jitter I5 
 display filter posisiton sensor I7
  Move ccw/cw  (0, ( , ), )0 
  Pulse Width XXXXXuS "M0" and "N0"
  Threshold XX "{0" and "}0"
  Jitter window "[0" "]0"
  Reset Jitter "R3" 
  maxspeed to 100% "R4" 
  Reset Threshold value to 30 "R5" 
  Calibrate "R6"
  pulse width xxxxxus I9
 
  
  


document extra protocol commands:
T0 = show hall effect state
R2 = reset all offsets to zero


offsets:
P1 Offset 120
P2 Offset 300
P3 Offset 220
P4 Offset 300
P5 Offset 380
